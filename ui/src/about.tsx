                Medicobud is a symptom analysis tool that helps users identify potential health risks based on their symptoms.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a healthcare professional, I have witnessed a major issue where diseases remain undiagnosed for extended periods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many conditions become life-threatening due to the lack of early diagnosis, often because of unaffordable medical procedures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Medicobud is a small initiative aimed at addressing this problem. The vision of Medicobud is both user-centric and organization-centric.
              </p>
              <p>
                I started Medicobud to apply my knowledge in a real-world setting and demonstrate how a production-grade application works.
              </p>
              <p>
                Medicobud features a user-friendly interface that collects user details, symptoms, and concerns, then analyzes the data to provide potential risk factors or diagnoses.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I continue learning and growing, I will keep enhancing Medicobud by adding new features and improving its functionality.

              I am on the mission of lifelong learning. I am a self-taught programmer who enjoys learning new things and solving problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              After taking a break from nursing, I decided to pursue my passion for programming.
              I started learning to code on my own and quickly fell in love with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started my programming journey by learning Python with David J. Malan's course on CS50 Introduction to Programming.
              After tasting the tip of the world of computer science, I decided to dive deeper into the world of programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              I discovered how we can use programming to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the last year, I have explored various programming languages and technologies, including Java, DSA, JavaScript, React, and Node.js.
              I have also worked on a variety of projects, including API, development pipeline, web applications, command-line tools, and data structures.

            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my career, I have worked in the neurology department and intensive care units of multispecialty hospitals. I have extensive experience handling critical cases and responding swiftly to life-threatening situations on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have had the privilege of caring for patients of all ages and backgrounds, which has given me a profound understanding of the healthcare system and the diverse needs of patients.
